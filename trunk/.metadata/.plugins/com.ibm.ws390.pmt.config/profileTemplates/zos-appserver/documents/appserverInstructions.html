<p><b>
The stand-alone application server will be configured with:

The Profile Management Tool has created jobs based on the information you          
provided. These instructions tell you how to modify the operating               
system and run the jobs to customize WebSphere Application Server for z/OS.  
When you upload the customization jobs to the target system, a text version of
these instructions will be written to:

The Profile Management Tool does not attempt to
update configuration data for your base operating system or existing
subsystems. You need to perform the following manual steps prior to running
the WebSphere for z/OS configuration jobs.

    MOUNT FILESYSTEM('${zConfigHfsName}') MOUNTPOINT('${zConfigMountPoint}') TYPE(${zFilesystemType}) MODE(RDWR)

If you are configuring in a sysplex environment, you may wish to use the NOAUTOMOVE parameter as follows:
<br>
<!-- if (${zFilesystemType}==ZFS) -->
<samp><xmp>
    MOUNT FILESYSTEM('${zConfigHfsName}') MOUNTPOINT('${zConfigMountPoint}') TYPE(${zFilesystemType}) MODE(RDWR) PARM('AGGRGROW') SYSNAME(${zSystemName}) NOAUTOMOVE

    MOUNT FILESYSTEM('${zConfigHfsName}') MOUNTPOINT('${zConfigMountPoint}') TYPE(${zFilesystemType}) MODE(RDWR) SYSNAME(${zSystemName}) NOAUTOMOVE
</xmp></samp>
<!-- endif -->
<b>Note:</b> The NOAUTOMOVE parameter prevents the configuration file system from being mounted on a different z/OS 
system in a shared file system configuration, which could cause performance problems.
<!-- if (${zFilesystemType}==ZFS) -->
<br><br>
If you have specified <i>aggrgrow=on</i> in your IOEFSPRM parmlib member, you can omit the AGGRGROW parm shown in the above examples

<li><b>The WebSphere product libraries will be placed in the system link
    pack area (LPA) and system link list.</b>
<p> 
    Check that no other copies of WebSphere Application server, from any
    release, reside in the link pack area or the system link list.  Also, 
    check that the target MVS system has at least 40MB of free storage in the
    extended CSA if SBBOLOAD is placed in the link pack area, or 8MB
    of free storage in extended CSA for the daemon and for each node
    (deployment manager node or application server node), if SBBOLOAD
    is placed in the link list.
</p> 
<br> 
<b>SBBOLOAD</b><br>
<br>You can either load the SBBOLOAD modules into the dynamic link pack
    area, which we recommend, or place SBBLOAD in the system link list.
<ul> 
<li><b>To load the SBBOLOAD modules into the dynamic link pack area,
       enter the following MVS console command:</b>
<samp><xmp> 
    SETPROG LPA,ADD,MASK=*,DSNAME=${zBboloadName}
</xmp></samp>
<p> 
Alternatively, you can place the following statement in a parmlib
PROGxx member which is activated with the SET PROG=xx 
command after system IPL is complete:
</p>
<samp><xmp> 
    LPA ADD MASK(*) DSNAME(${zBboloadName})
</xmp></samp>
<p> 
    Check that sure that the SBBOLOAD modules are loaded into LPA after each
    system IPL.
</p>
</li>
<li><b>To put the SBBOLOAD data set into the system link list.</b>
<br>Determine whether your system uses static (LNKLSTxx) or dynamic
(PROGxx) link list definition, and add the following data set name to the
appropriate LNKLSTxx or PROGxx member. (An IPL will normally be required.)
<br><br>
<samp><xmp>        
    ${zBboloadName}
</xmp></samp>
</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<br><br>
<b>SBBGLOAD</b>
<br><br>
If your servers will be running in 64-bit mode, the SBBGLOAD data
set must be added to the system link list or link pack area      
following the same procedure as for the SBBOLOAD data set.     
<br><br> 
<b>SBBOLD2</b>
<br><br> 
    Place the SBBOLD2 data set into the system link list.  This data
    set must NOT be placed in the system link pack area;  separate
    copies of the SBBOLD2 modules need to be loaded into each WebSphere
    Application Server address space.
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>To put the SBBOLD2 data set into the system link list</b>
<br>Determine whether your system uses static (LNKLSTxx) or dynamic (PROGxx)
link list definition, and add the following data set name to the

    The BBORTS61 module is used by WebSphere Application Server for

</p>
<p> 
    If a copy of BBORTS61 is currently loaded into LPA, no further action is required.
</p><p> 
    Otherwise, issue the following MVS console command to load BBORTS61 into dynamic LPA:
</p>
<samp><xmp> 
    SETPROG LPA,ADD,MODNAME=BBORTS61,DSNAME=${zBbolpaName}

    Alternatively, you can place the following statement in a parmlib

    system IPL is complete:
</p>
<samp><xmp> 
    LPA ADD MODNAME(BBORTS61) DSNAME(${zBbolpaName})

Running the customized jobs
</h3>
<br>
<p> 
The Profile Management Tool built a number of batch jobs with the
variables you supplied. You need to run the jobs in the order listed
below, using user IDs with the appropriate authority.
</p> <br>
<b>Note:</b> Whenever "file system update authority" is indicated, the user
      ID used to run the configuration job must have
      EITHER <samp>uid = 0</samp>
          OR the following UNIXPRIV class profile privileges:
<samp><xmp>        
    CONTROL access to SUPERUSER.FILESYS
    UPDATE  access to SUPERUSER.FILESYS.MOUNT
    READ    access to SUPERUSER.FILESYS.CHOWN
    READ    access to SUPERUSER.FILESYS.CHANGEPERMS
    READ    access to SUPERUSER.FILESYS.PFSCTL
</xmp></samp>
<p> 
      If the <samp>UNIXPRIV profile CHOWN.UNRESTRICTED</samp> is defined, then
      the <samp>SUPERUSER.FILESYS.CHOWN</samp> is not required.  For information
      about the UNIXPRIV class, see the z/OS Unix System Services
      Planning book.
</p> 
<b>Before you begin: </B> Complete the section above entitled "Manual configuration updates".
<BR><br> 
Follow the steps below, which lists in order the jobs you must submit               
and the commands you must enter. Special handling notes are included                
in the steps. All jobs are members of:
<BR> 
<samp><xmp>
    ${zTargetHLQ}.CNTL
</xmp></samp>
<BR><br> 
<B>Attention: </B> After submitting each job, carefully check the output.
Errors may exist even when all return codes are zero.
<BR><br>
The next three jobs (BBOSBRAJ, BBOSBRAK, BBOSBRAM) do not need to be run if the indicated groups, user IDs  
and directories already exist with the correct gid, uid and ownership permission values, as given below.
<br><br>
In order for RACF to automatically select an unused UID or GID value for WebSphere Application Server user IDs
and groups:
<br><br>
- The RACF profile SHARED.IDS must be defined.<br>
- The RACF profile BPX.NEXT.USER must be define and use to indicate the ranges from which UID and GID values are to be selected.
<br><br>

To use RACF password phrase support, your target system must be at z/OS Version 1.9 and WebSphere Application Server
Fix Pack 6.1.0.15 or later.

If you are using a different security system, make sure  
that the ${zAdminUserid} user ID has a password or password phrase.

<b>Result: </b> You may receive errors, such as INVALID USER     
messages, from this job because a user ID, group  or     
profile is already defined.  Make sure the existing      
user ID, group or profile has the same characteristics   
as the user ID, group or profile being created by        
BBOCBRAK.  If not, then change the values in the         
Profile Management Tool which are causing the conflict,     
upload the updated customization jobs, and restart the process.

<b>Attention:</b>
If operator commands are protected by the z/OS security 
server at your installation, you must ensure that       
sufficient authority is given to WebSphere Application Server tasks to     
control operations.                                     
<br>
<p>The Application Server Controller user ID

tasks belonging to WebSphere Application Server for z/OS.

The asynchronous administrator user ID, and any user    
ID used to run the federation job when the node agent   
is started automatically, need the authority to issue   
the MVS START command.

If you are currently controlling MVS console command

Then correct the problem that caused BBOWWPFA to fail and re-run the job.

The customization dialog has created jobs based on the information you          
provided. These instructions tell you how to modify the operating               
system and run the jobs to customize WebSphere for z/OS.

1.  If you created the target data sets (*.CNTL and *.DATA) on another          
    (driving) system, you must copy them to the target system and give          
    them the same data set names.

The customization dialog for WebSphere for z/OS does not attempt to             
update configuration data for your base operating system or existing
